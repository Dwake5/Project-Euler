// The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
// 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
// The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
// (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
// Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
// Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

// As per usual I have solved this generally, so you can enter any number an

const differenceBetweenSquareAndSum = (number) => {
  let square = 0

    square += i**2
  }
  let sumSquare = ((number/2)*(number+1))**2
  
  return sumSquare - square
