// Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
// If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

// For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

// Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

// I used the function I made for problem 12 to find how many factors are in a number,
// And altered it to output the sum of the factors. 
// I then iterated up to the max input, and save the result of putting in i.
// Then put that result back through the function. If i and the second result are equal.
// They are pushed into the amicable array. 
// This array is then uniqued with Set(arr) and reduced to its sum.
