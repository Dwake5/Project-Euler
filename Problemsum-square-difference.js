// The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
// 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
// The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
// (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
// Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
// Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

// As per usual I have solved this generally, so you can enter any number and have it calcuated for you.
// The answer to the specific question with 20 is: 44100 - 2870 = 41230
