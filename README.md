# Project-Euler
My solutions to Project Euler problems. 

<a href="https://projecteuler.net/about">This is a page</a> about the problems and  <a href="https://projecteuler.net/archives">here is a list</a> of the problems. 

There are many websites you can go on to practice programming, normally with difficult bite size problems.
These include HackerRank, Codewars, TopCoder and CodinGame. 

I use a variety of these to hone my skills, but like project euluer the most as it combines my two biggest passions, Programming and Math.
