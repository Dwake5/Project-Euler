# Project-Euler

My solutions to Project Euler problems.

Total completed: 23

Highest completed: 58 (67 is void because same as 18)

<a href="https://projecteuler.net/about">This is a page</a> about the problems and <a href="https://projecteuler.net/archives">here is a list</a> of the problems.

There are many websites you can go on to practice programming, normally with difficult bite size problems.
These include HackerRank, Codewars, TopCoder and CodinGame.

I use a variety of these to hone my skills, but like Project Euler the most as it combines my two biggest passions, Programming and Math.

If you would like to review my work, I would recommend problems 5, 8 and 14 for the complexity, efficiency and elegance of my solutions.
